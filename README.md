# FLL-Visual-Navigation
This is the source code to my project that I shared on my youtube channel. The link is https://youtu.be/6bAVWOm49GU in case if you want to watch it. Basically you can navigate the EV3 robot on an FLL (First Lego League) mat using a picture and waypoints. 

In lines 39, 174 and 558, make sure that the path for the image included is correct, as the pathname used in the script was on my computer, and yours will vary. 

In order for this to work you're EV3 brain must be running microPython. If it isn't click this link to see how to install it https://education.lego.com/en-us/support/mindstorms-ev3/python-for-ev3 .

Aditionally, make sure that you have pygame installed on your computer.
